She connected the guitar to the amp
The soldiers were wearing camo
The meal was heavy on carbs
The doctors treated the cancer with chemo
The zookeeper tossed a banana to the chimp
They bought a two-bedroom condo
We bought the sandwich meat from the deli

She filled up the car with gas
He started lifting weights at the gym
They conducted experiments in the lab
The newlyweds drove away in a limo
Her voice was picked up by the mic
He plays the sax
